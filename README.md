# SBI_IFSC_Code

dependencies = {

}

This script lets you get IFSC code of SBI branches all over the India. You have to give query in the form STATE+DISTRICT+BRANCHNAME. There can be small typos as well in the branch name, but the results will still be correct. 
P.S - Be soft on making request , else you will be blocked by the server. 


You can setup proxies to make concurrent request.
